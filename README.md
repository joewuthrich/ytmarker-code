# ytmarker-code
The code for my website ytmarker.com

ytmarker.com is designed to be an easy way to mark youtube videos while watching, so you can replay the highlights to others.

It was originally designed for CS50x, with the idea that I could use it to highlight events in my basketball games as the other options
cost significant amounts of moneyand I didn't find them easy to use.
